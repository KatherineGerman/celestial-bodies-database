# PostgreSQL Database Project

## Overview
This project was created as a practice exercise to enhance my understanding of PostgreSQL. The project simulates a space-related database, including tables for galaxies, stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.

## What I Learned
### 1. **Database Design & Table Creation**
   - Learned how to create structured tables with appropriate data types.
   - Defined foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

### 2. **Data Modification & Updates**
   - Used `UPDATE` statements to modify existing records.
   - Adjusted column types using `ALTER TABLE` when necessary.
   - Ensured that data updates aligned with foreign key constraints.

### 3. **Querying Data**
   - Practiced `SELECT` queries to retrieve data efficiently.
   - Used `JOIN` operations to combine data from related tables.
   - Applied `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and filtering techniques for better data retrieval.
